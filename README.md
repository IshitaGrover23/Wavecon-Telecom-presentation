📡 Wavecon Telecom 5G Impact Analysis

🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the impact of 5G technology rollout on Wavecon Telecom's business operations. The analysis was conducted during a Week 2 virtual internship with AtliQ Technologies, focusing on transforming raw telecom data into actionable business intelligence using PowerBI dashboards.
🏢 Company Context

India's 3rd largest telecom provider
161.7M active users across 15 key markets (pre-5G)
Nationwide 5G rollout in Q1 2025
₹31.9B in total revenue (pre-5G)

📊 Key Findings

Revenue Impact: 0.50% decline (₹80M) despite 11.05% increase in ARPU
User Base: 8.28% decrease in active users (84.4M → 77.4M)
Unsubscription Crisis: 23.5% increase in unsubscriptions (5.6M → 7.0M)
Geographic Variation: 6 cities showing growth vs. 5 cities with >2% decline
Plan Performance: Identified underperforming plans, with plan p7 (25GB Combo 3G/4G Data Pack) showing 73% revenue decline

⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

Primary Unsubscription Hotspots:

Lucknow: 77.9% increase
Pune: 55.3% increase
Jaipur: 52.4% increase


Market Position:

Maintaining 19-20% market share throughout 5G rollout
Losing low-value customers while retaining high-value ones
Competitors: PIO_Ms (~36% dominant) and Britel_Ms (27.4%, slight decline)



💡 Strategic Recommendations
🕒 Short-Term (0-3 Months)

Launch "5G Value+" campaigns in Delhi and Chennai
Scale successful plans from Lucknow to similar markets
Revise premium plan pricing in underperforming markets
Implement immediate actions for unsubscription crisis:

Price correction (15-20% reduction in top 3 churn cities)
Create "5G Loyalty" packages for existing customers
Deploy tiered retention campaign for recent unsubscribers
Conduct network quality audit in problem areas



📅 Medium-Term (3-12 Months)

Implement ARPU enhancement initiatives (₹200.7 → ₹225+)
Prioritize infrastructure improvements in negative-growth cities
Develop unique 5G service bundles and partnerships

🌆 Priority Cities for 5G Investment

Mumbai & Patna: High ARPU + large revenue base
Lucknow: Positive user growth trend (+2.65%) despite overall decline
Coimbatore: Strong ARPU growth (+8.25%) indicates potential
Target these cities to generate additional ₹1.2B in annual revenue

🥇 Competitive Strategy

vs. PIO_Ms (36% market share):

Launch "Switch & Save" campaign highlighting 15-20% cost advantage
Target their high-ARPU customers with superior service bundles in Mumbai


vs. Britel_Ms (27.4% market share):

Focus on network quality in Tier-2 cities where they underperform
Implement retention program targeting their customers in Patna & Coimbatore
