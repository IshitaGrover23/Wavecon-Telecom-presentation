Wavecon Telecom 5G Impact Analysis

Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the impact of 5G technology rollout on Wavecon Telecom's business operations. The analysis was conducted during a Week 2 virtual internship with AtliQ Technologies, focusing on transforming raw telecom data into actionable business intelligence using PowerBI dashboards.
Company Context

India's 3rd largest telecom provider
161.7M active users across 15 key markets (pre-5G)
Nationwide 5G rollout in Q1 2025
₹31.9B in total revenue (pre-5G)

Key Findings

Revenue Impact: 0.50% decline (₹80M) despite 11.05% increase in ARPU
User Base: 8.28% decrease in active users (84.4M → 77.4M)
Unsubscription Crisis: 23.5% increase in unsubscriptions (5.6M → 7.0M)
Geographic Variation: 6 cities showing growth vs. 5 cities with >2% decline
Plan Performance: Identified underperforming plans, with plan p7 (25GB Combo 3G/4G Data Pack) showing 73% revenue decline

Critical Issues Identified

Primary Unsubscription Hotspots:

Lucknow: 77.9% increase
Pune: 55.3% increase
Jaipur: 52.4% increase


Market Position:

Maintaining 19-20% market share throughout 5G rollout
Losing low-value customers while retaining high-value ones
Competitors: PIO_Ms (~36% dominant) and Britel_Ms (27.4%, slight decline)



Strategic Recommendations
Short-Term (0-3 Months)

Launch "5G Value+" campaigns in Delhi and Chennai
Scale successful plans from Lucknow to similar markets
Revise premium plan pricing in underperforming markets
Implement immediate actions for unsubscription crisis:

Price correction (15-20% reduction in top 3 churn cities)
Create "5G Loyalty" packages for existing customers
Deploy tiered retention campaign for recent unsubscribers
Conduct network quality audit in problem areas



Medium-Term (3-12 Months)

Implement ARPU enhancement initiatives (₹200.7 → ₹225+)
Prioritize infrastructure improvements in negative-growth cities
Develop unique 5G service bundles and partnerships

Priority Cities for 5G Investment

Mumbai & Patna: High ARPU + large revenue base
Lucknow: Positive user growth trend (+2.65%) despite overall decline
Coimbatore: Strong ARPU growth (+8.25%) indicates potential
Target these cities to generate additional ₹1.2B in annual revenue

Competitive Strategy

vs. PIO_Ms (36% market share):

Launch "Switch & Save" campaign highlighting 15-20% cost advantage
Target their high-ARPU customers with superior service bundles in Mumbai


vs. Britel_Ms (27.4% market share):

Focus on network quality in Tier-2 cities where they underperform
Implement retention program targeting their customers in Patna & Coimbatore
